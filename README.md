# IFJ23 tests

## How to use

- First, set your compiler binary path in file `test_runtime.py`, at the top,
  in variable `COMPILER_PATH`

- Then, run tests by executing `python3 compiler_tests.py`

## Warning

Tests are written for our project, and we implement a part of BOOLTHEN extension,
which means that some tests might not work for you. If some brave soul rewrites all
the tests that don't work without BOOLTHEN or just comments them out, I will accept
it as a PR.
